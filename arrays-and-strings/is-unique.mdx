# Is Unique

## Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 1.1

## Question

You are given a string. Write a function to determine if all of the characters in the string appear only once.

Your function shouldn't care about capitalization. `A` is the same as `a`.

```
Input - "heLlo"
Output - False

Input - "hey"
Output - True
```

  <summary>Brute Force Solution</summary>


For each character in the input string, check every other character and make sure they're different.

```python
def isUnique(s):
    s = s.lower()
    # c -> counter, l -> letter
    for c1, l1  in enumerate(s):
        for c2, l2 in enumerate(s):
            if c1 == c2:
                continue
            if l1 == l2:
                return False
    return True
```

We implement this with two loops. The first loop iterates through every character in the string.

For each iteration, we will check to make sure that this character does not appear again in the string. We do this with the nested loop.

The time complexity is $$O(n^2)$$. The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ since we're creating a new string on line 3.

  <summary>Optimized Solution</summary>


Instead of using two loops, we can use a set. As we iterate through the string, we check if the current letter is in the set.

If it is, then we return `False`. Otherwise, we add the current letter to the set and continue iterating.

```python
def isUnique(s):
    s = s.lower()
    seen = set()
    for c in s:
        if c in seen:
            return False
        else:
            seen.add(c)
    return True
```

The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(n)$$.

What if you're not allowed to use any additional data structures?

  <summary>Follow Up Solution</summary>


The brute force solution doesn't use any extra data structures, but can we do better than $$O(n^2)$$ time complexity?

Instead of using two for loops, what if we sorted the string and then just checked if any of the characters were equivalent to the character before them?

We're taking advantage of the fact that if you sort the string, all identical characters will be placed right next to each other.

```python
def isUnique(s):
    s = sorted(s.lower())
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

The time complexity is $$O(n \log n)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(n)$$.
