# Question

Design a method to find the frequency of occurances of any given word in a book? What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?


<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>

  Always be careful with questions like there where the solution is simple but there might be small details you need to think about. Asking follow up questions to clear things up is a must. Think about corner cases, is ```Hi!``` the same word as ```hi```? How would you separate them?

  <summary>Single Query Solution</summary>

  Let's tackle it without the follow up of "running this algorithm multiple times". If given a string, how would you count frequency of a certain word? Brute force option of scanning through all words in the string is the most optimal here. 

  - Set ```count``` to 0
  - Go through each word in the "book"
  - Check if the word is the same as word to count the frequency of (methods like .lower() will have to be used if case is to be ignored - something to check with your interviewer)
  - If words match, increment count

```python
import string  # Importing standard library is okay during interview

def single_query(book: List[str], word: str):
    count = 0

    for w in book:
        w = w.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))  # Remove any punctuations such as ```,``` and ```.``` from the word
        if word == w.trim().lower():  # this could be .upper() too, depends on the use case
            count += 1
    
    return count
  ```

  <summary>Multiple Use Solution</summary>

  Solution above works just fine if you were to run the query once and forget about it. But what happens if you were asked to check frequency of each word in the book? Is going through the entire book worth it? Probably not. 

  Whenever you think of storing multiple counts, think of hashmaps or dictionaries in Python. It's a very efficient data structure to store key value pairs. Here, our key can be each word and value can be their counts.

  - Create dictionary
    - Initialise the dictionary
    - Go through each word in the "book"
    - Strip off punctuations and spaces
    - Increment word count


  - Find the frequency
      - Return value of the word in dict if exists 

```python
# Importing standard library is okay during interview
import string  
from collections import defaultdict  

def multiple_queries(book: List[str], word: str):
    
    # this saves us from the logic of "+1 if word exists otherwise set to 0". defaultdict will initialise the key to have value of 0 if it currently doesn't exist in the dict
    word_count = defaultdict(int)  

    for w in book:
        w = w.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))  # Remove any punctuations such as ```,``` and ```.``` from the word
        if word == w.lower():  # this could be .upper() too, depends on the use case
            word_count[word] += 1
    
    return word_count


def get_frequency(word_count, word):
    return word_count[word] if word in word_count else 0
```

  <summary>Further Enhancement</summary>
  This is a good opportunity for you to show your knowledge of caching to your interviewer. It could be as simple as saving the python dict object to disk. Quickest and simplest way to do this would be to use ```joblib``` package where you can ```.dump()``` a variable to disk or ```.load()``` into a variable from disk. If multiple books need to be cached, this method might be the best option.
